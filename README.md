# About the stickers 
 
There are a total of 20 stickers for 20 different well know technologies, you can browser the repository or see them all in our website [HexStickers.com][hx] 
 
The stickers are hexagonal so that can be tiled in any surface and they will look awesome and well curate. 
 
We followed the standard proposed by Terin Stock in his repo: [StickerConstructorSpec](https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec). 
 
Following this specification means that you can use our stickers next to the one of other vendors. 
 
# Repository Structure 
 
Under the folder `artworks` you will find all and 20 our technologies, inside each folder there are two files. 
     
    1. A simple PNG 
    2. A SVG 
 
The PNG is the simple image that can be showed in the web, however is difficult to modify and to work with. 
 
The SVG is simpler to modify and is actually ready to be printed, there is a blue dashed border line which is where the sticker should be cut. If you actually go to print the sticker you will need that line. 
 
# I want more 
 
If you would like different technologies in the same style there are two main way. 
 
    1. Design the sticker yourself and license it in a business friendly way so that we can actually sell it. 
    2. Ask for it opening an issues. 
 
Please consider that we all have a full time job, so we do not guarantee that we have the actual time to work on it. 
 
However if you bribe us (with any order in our website) and you ask for another technology that we don't have yet, we guarantee that we will design it and include it in your package. 
 
# Your website says WallOfSticker and not HexSticker 
 
I know, I just bought the domain and I am moving the whole website. 
 
# Why you didn't pair up with hexb.in ? 
 
I tried. I open an issues in their repo and I also send an email.
